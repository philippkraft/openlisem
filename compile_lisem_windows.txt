openLISEM: Quick guideline for code development on Windows
==========================================================
Date: 241203

Introduction:
openLISEM is compiled with MINGW64, the windows port of the native Linux compiler.
The advantage is that it is opensource and free, and easy to compile lisem under Linux.
It is developed in the Qt environment for the interface and extension of C++ libs

For linux compile see the file "compile_lisem_linux.txt" in the GitHub repository

> The following software is needed
- MSYS is the installation environment used for MINGW64 and all libraries needed, such as Qt.
- Qt is the development environment for the code (installed by MSYS)
- QWT is a set of libraries for graphical output (https://qwt.sourceforge.io/) downloaded in MSYS. HOWEVER: we use a separate branch of this lib.
- CMAKE is part of the code development and compilation, it generates file for MINGW
- GIT: to download and manage the openLISEM code from github


-------------- step 1 ---------------

> Download MSYS2.0 

Open the MSYS command window and execute the following commands. 
(answer "y" when asked.)

update MSYS itself:
Pacman -Syu
The window may close, simply open it again

-install the following base packages:
	pacman -S base-devel git mercurial cvs wget p7zip ccache
	pacman -S perl ruby python mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

-install qt6 which is for now the version in which lisem is created:
	pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt6 mingw-w64-x86_64-qt-creator 
-install openmp, gdal, qwt, openssl:
        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-openmp mingw-w64-x86_64-gdal mingw-w64-x86_64-qwt-qt6 openssl

note: we are not using this version of qwt but a changed one, but install it anyway for the source code.

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG YOU CAN UNINSTALL AND START AGAIN. 
BUT DELETE BY HAND THE MSYS64 FOLDER, THE UNINSTALL PROCESS DOES NOT CLEAN UP EVERYTHING! 

{NOTE: info on pacman options: https://devhints.io/pacman)

Add the minw location to the windows path (see e.g. here on how to do that: https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/):
c:\[your path]\msys64\mingw64 
c:\[your path]\msys64\mingw64\bin

restart your PC after this step!


-------------- step 2 ---------------

> get the GIT and CMAKE software
Install git latest version: https://git-scm.com/
Install cmake lastest version: https://cmake.org (do not use cmake from msys2, it gave me problems)
If you want use Tortoise GIT for an easy integration of GIT commands into the winfows explorer: https://tortoisegit.org/

> Download the openLISEM code from github:
Register online at github.com
create an empty directory "lisem" for the code, e.g. c:/prgc/lisem
create an empty directory for the compiled executable (do not make it a subdirectory of lisem), e.g. c:/prgc/lisem-bin

> go into github to the repository: https://github.com/vjetten/openlisem
click on the green "<> code" tab and copy the address to clone it to your PC: https://github.com/vjetten/openlisem.git

open a CMD window in the empty folder and type:
git clone https://github.com/vjetten/openlisem.git .
(do not forget the '.')

Or do this via tortoisegit

all openlisem code will be downloaded now

THE MAIN BRANCH is "main_c" !!!! (not main or master)

> read about GIT, for instance make a branch for yourself (e.g. "mylisem) do
git branch mylisem
git checkout mylisem


-------------- step 3 ---------------

> generate the CMAKE files for MINGW to compile lisem

open cmake-gui (should be in your list of programmes after installation). 

In the interface, the first field  ("where is the source code") should point to the folder 'lisem' with the github code
the second field ("where to build the binaries") should point to the still empty folder 'lisem-bin'
press configure, choose "MingW makefiles" 

-------------- step 4 ---------------
qtcreator is in the MSYS folder: C:\[your path]\msys64\mingw64\bin\qtcreator.exe

We need a branch of QWT that can display multiple axes for the line graph: https://github.com/cseci/qwt/tree/qwt-multiaxes
clone this code in an empty repository and load the qwt.pro file in qtcreator and compile it.
You should have the compiled libraries of qwt somewhere:
libqwt.dll.a; 
libqwtd.dll.a; 
qwt.dll; 
qwtd.dll;


-------------- step 5 ---------------

> compile the code

Open Qtcreator (C:\[your path]\msys64\mingw64\bin\qtcreator.exe) and load the file "CMakeList.txt" in the folder 'lisem'
click on edit in the left bar. You should now see the complete tree structure of the code. 
Because you have your own dirs for MINGW and QWT you have to tell the code wehre to find it:

find aplication.cmake under "CMake Modules" and change these lines too yoru own folder names:
IF(WIN32)
    # QWT configuration for double axis display, note a double axis branch of qwt is used
    SET(QWT_BUILD_DIR "C:/prgc/lisemgit/qwt/git")    # Adjust to your folder names
    SET(MINGW_BUILD_DIR "c:/qt/msys64/mingw64")     # Adjust to your folder names
    
    [...]
ENDIF()

Click on Projects in the left bar and add '-j' to the "build steps" to speed up the compilation:
cmake.exe --build C:/prgc/lisem-msys --target all -j

You can now try to compile for the first time.

-------------- step 6 ---------------
> Run lisem as executable  without qtcreator:



In order to run lisem you have to copy all necessary dll's into the lisem bin folder:
- copy ALL dlls from  "../msys64/mingw64/bin/*.dll" into the lisem bin directory (where lisem.exe is)
- make a subdirectory "../lib/ossl-modules" at the same level as the bin directory and copy the file "/msys64/mingw64/lib/ossl-modules/legacy.dll" to that directory
- make a subdirectory "../bin/platforms" in the bin folder and copy the file "..\msys64\mingw64\share\qt6\plugins\platforms\qwindows.dll" to a that directory
- make a subdirectory "../bin/tls" in the bin folder and copy the file "..\msys64\mingw64\share\qt6\plugins\tls\qopensslbackend.dll to that directory
- open a command window in that folder and set the path to only c:\ with the command "path=c:\"
- open lisem and while it is open got to the command window and and delete all the dlls: "del *.dll". The ones that are used by lisem are blocked from deletion

that should do it


best of luck!

openLISEM README (130517)
=========================
LATEST CHANGES (v 1.70-1.71)
- Solution for 2nd order, works now!
- map display shows meters on x and y axes insted of rows/cols
- moved rainfall display to the right of the graph is there is no erosion

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.67-1.69)
- improved channel and flood water mixing
- improved display, houses now also visible
- map can be switched after run has stopped
known issues: flood SWOF order 2 not working

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.61-1.67)
- Added flooding code from the fullSWOF2D project (Univ Orleans, http://www.univ-orleans.fr/mapmo/soft/FullSWOF/)
- Added a flood mass balance error spreading over flood area to keep mass balance below 0.1 percent
- Runoff continues partly in flooded area with large flow resistsance
- Restyled infiltration code to adapt to flooding
- Changed gras strip infiltration to simpler change of effective Ksat to work with flooding
- Added simple drainage function (soilwater) decrease when bottom layer is not impermebale, thetai is adapted
- TODO: fullswof 2nd order doesn't work yet

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.60-1.61)
- Tuned flooding, mass balance error down to a few percent 
- FIXED A BUG SINCE VERSION 1.55 FOR DEPOSITION

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.57-1.60)
- Added FLOODING!!! Still in beta stage but seems to work for shallow floods from channel system. 
- Added better map display with roads and channels
ToDo: mass balance with flooding not correct

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.55-1.56)
- Added shaded relief for map display (needs dem.map)
- Added a small hydrograph plot next to the map display
- Added multiple screenshots (every timestep) to make a movie
- Fixed a long standing bug crshing lisem at the end of a run (hopefully)

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.39-1.54)
- Can now read rainfall and snowmelt maps (maps should have flux in mm/h)
- added map display
- added land use map for stats output per land use type
- many small bug fixes (such as sobek output)

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.38)
- Bug fixes in Swatre, introduced in previous version, crash when profile becomes sturated

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.37)
- Bug fix kinetic energy time based, in hours instead of seconds, factor 1/3600

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.35-1.36)
-SWATRE  include water repellency
- Bug fix  saturation bug in SWATRE, NaN when profile is saturated

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.34)
- Fixed bug in output of erosion units, kg/m2 = kg/cell and vice versa, ton/ha ok

Changes (v 1.33)
- fixed bugs buffer operation, wrong reporting of buffer in mass balance
- sedimentation in buffer works correctly now
- interface refining
- compiled with QT 4.7.3

Changes (v 1.28-1.32)
- EXPERIMENTAL epellency as a special case fo crusting. Works for Swatre only.

Changes (v 1.27)
- fixed bugs in tiledrain part
- added tiledrain flux to output map series
- cleaned up SWATRE infil

Changes (v 1.26)
- recompiled with 4.7.3 version of Qt
- fixed a bug that reported averages and totals (last version was affected)
- added calibration factors for theta and psi 
- added kinetic energy equations for rainfall splash 
- changes to te interface and small bug fixes

1) The openLISEM model 
======================

This is the event based spatial runoff and erosion model openLISEM. Thank you 
for downloading. openLISEM simulates the spatial dynamics of surface runoff and 
erosion for catchments of 1 ha to 500 km2. It is based on the LISEM model that 
is available here: www.itc.nl/lisem. Details about the theory and dataset for 
now can be found on this website (although a bit outdated). openLISEM uses the 
freeware GIS PCRaster (http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl) for database creation and 
analysis of the results. 

2) Terms of use 
===============
This software is free and open source, hosted by  sourceforge.net. The project 
details can be found on:  http://lisem.sourceforge.net

All license details can be found on this website. The compiled model openLISEM 
and the source code, or parts of the source code can be used for any purpose, 
but the disclaimer as specified below is in effect. openLISEM in any version

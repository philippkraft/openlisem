openLISEM: Quick guideline for code development on Linux (Ubuntu)
=================================================================
Date: 241111

Introduction:
openLISEM is developed in the Qt environment for the interface and extension of C++ libs.
The following steps are needed to compile openLISEM on ubuntu (24.04 LTS).

> The following software is needed:
- Qt6 is the development environment for the code
- QWT is a set of libraries for graphical output (https://qwt.sourceforge.io/). HOWEVER: we use a separate branch of this lib.
- CMAKE is part of the code development and compilation.
- GIT: to download and manage the openLISEM code from github

-------------- step 1 ---------------
Install all the software:

# C++, compilers and python etc
sudo apt install cmake cmake-gui gcc g++ git libboost-all-dev libncurses5-dev libpython3-dev libqwt-qt6-dev libxerces-c-dev libxml2 libxml2-utils libxslt1-dev python3-numpy qt6-base-dev python3-docopt

# opengl:
sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

# install gdal (https://mothergeo-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/how-to/gdal-ubuntu-pkg.html)
sudo apt install gdal-bin libgdal-dev

# add GDAL to paths:
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal

# compile qwt libraries based on this explanation
- download the qwt with multiaxis from sourceforge:
- https://sourceforge.net/p/qwt/git/ci/qwt-multiaxes/tree/
- compile this based on the following instructions: https://qwt.sourceforge.io/qwtinstall.html
- NOTE. If the module QWTSvg gives an error while compiling. We don't need it so an # can be placed bfore this line in qwtconfig.pri
#QWT_CONFIG     += QwtSvg

# all software is now installed.

---------------- step 2 ---------------------
> Download the openLISEM code from github:
- create an empty directory "lisem" for the code, e.g. ~/prgc/lisem
- create an empty directory for the compiled executable (do not make it a subdirectory of lisem), e.g. ~/prgc/lisem-bin
> go into github to the repository: https://github.com/vjetten/openlisem
click on the green "<> code" tab and copy the address to clone it to your PC: https://github.com/vjetten/openlisem.git
> clone via git command line or your favorite GUI.

Note: THE MAIN BRANCH is "main_c" !!!! (not main or master)
Please do NOT merge your code with main_c before consultation with me (v.g.jetten@utwente.nl)!

---------------- step 3 --------------------
> generate the CMAKE files to compile lisem
open cmake-gui (should be in your list of programmes after installation). 

In the interface, the first field  ("where is the source code") should point to the folder 'lisem' with the github code.
The second field ("where to build the binaries") should point to the still empty folder 'lisem-bin'

Press configure, choose "UNIX makefiles" 

-------------- step 4 ---------------
> compile the code

Open Qtcreator and load the file "CMakeList.txt" in the folder 'lisem'.
Click on edit in the left bar. You should now see the complete tree structure of the code.

Click on Projects in the left bar and add '-j' to the "build steps" to speed up the compilation.

This should compile OpenLISEM

best of luck!

Lisem 2.6.1 (VJ 091213)
- hard surfaces also no infiltration now
- output text files for all points in outlet.map even if more than 3, reported as one file or as name_#1.ext etc.
- deleted outlet 2 and 3 names in interface
- buf fix: switched surf storage: simple storage means max depr is hard limit, if unselected old depr storage calculation
- added soilloss map = sum detachment and deposition
- added quick and dirty calibration
- forgot read erosion map units in temp run file, version 2.6
- added empty result dir check
- changed interface, output mapnames select only, names not changeable except edit of runfile
lisem 2.6.0 (VJ 090521)
- noprocess changes but further decouplingof interface and model
- model now clled with temp run file that is parsed
lisem 2.5.9
- made RR start-storage or fullstorage an option
- minor changes nd cleaning up code
lisem 2.5.8 (VJ 090226)
- added 'celltest' function in cpstest.c where the cell is found that gioves a problem compared to the LDD

lisem 2.5.7 (VJ 090214)
- added option to switch between old and new depression storage modelling
- added option to force all overlabd flow water and sediment into the channel in the outet
  cell. In principle LISEM kept these fluxes separate although the reporting was the sum of all
  fluxes. But that is not the same
lisem 2.5.7 (VJ 090207)
- added robust MV checking against LDD with function celltest (in cpstest.c, chkdata.c)

- fixed bug link mindt swatre interface to code, interface value was ignored
- added runtime length in message
lisem 2.5.3 (VJ 080620)

  not as Qsed/Q
- fixed bug in infiltration, caused in version 2.5.2 
lisem 2.5.2 (VJ 080423-080614)
- fixed bug with endless loop when missing map

- bug fix in commandline running, wrong check for lisemtype
- bug fix in checkpestout, listens to cammndline only
lisem 2.3.9 (VJ 051005)
- adjusted Green and Ampt wheeltrack and grassstrip infiltration according to latest changes
  (such as drainage)
- added kinematic wave and channel infiltration correctly to multiple class and nutrient kine wave
- cleaned up minematic.c function
- added calc(" Qsedout += cover(ChannelQsedout,0) "); etc for channel, gully and wheeltrack to mass balance sediment
- cleaned up library warnings, include string.h, pre-compile etc
- deleted kinematic and ninematic functions form cps lib
lisem 2.3.8 (VJ 050913)

	where lisemtype = 0-4 (basic, wheeltrack, multiclass, nutrients, gully)
- Added cancel option to restore default names button
- 2.362: fixed infiltration map bug -> now infil in kin wave (incl channel and gully) is added so totals match screen and output
	note: both vars have terrain slope included
  THIS NOT INCLUDED YET in nutrient and multiclass versions
- 2.361: fixed bugs in GA, impermeable layer, soildepth has no effect unless drainage or impermeable layer is chosen

- fixed batch runs with lisemwin.ini
- decreased minimum n to 1e-5
- added drainage to green and ampt from 1st (G&A 1 layer) or second (G&A 2 layer), incl GAgrass and GAWheel. Drainage is
  calclated as dt*k where k = ksat*(moisture/porosity)**d. d is a user defined drainage factor
- fixed bug: Green and Ampt: when impermeable soildepth was limited but this did not influence infiltration rate!
- fixed bug: text in interface infiltration for soildepth says cm should be mm
lisem 2.3.5 (VJ 050808)
- fixed bug in cpstimin.c, wrong assumption to deal with rounding of errors
- fixed small bug in fileoutput, calculation of sed conc for outlet2 and 3
lisem 2.3.4 (VJ 050704)
- surplus infil fluxes into kin wave wrong, must be multiplied by DX and not by DXc

lisem 2.3.3 (VJ 050301)
- fixed a bug so channels can run with wheeltracks
- changed: new analysis PondAreaFract = 1-exp(-1.875*WH/(RR*10))
lisem 2.3.2 (VJ 050301)
- can choose alternative simplified flow detachment: Df=Q*dt(TC-C)*Y instead of Df=w*h*vs*dt(TC-C)*Y
- new ponded area: simplified to calc(" PondAreaFract = 1-exp(-1.88*WH/(RR*10)) ");
- bug fix: V was not recalculated in channel cells after subtraction of tochannel,
	so wrong stream power in channel cells
lisem 2.300 (VJ 040823)
- changed version numbering: major ver 2, minor ver 3, release 0, build = 2.3.0.0

  along gully perimeter (instead of Q-W relation)
- fixed small bug when double click on input map now go to map directory
- FIXED BUG (040224) in area ponding calculation, /10 or *10. /10 gives very smooth
  surfaces and area is 100% very quickly, should be *10 (cm to mm)
lisem 2.161 VJ 031218
- removed coh=100 limit in Y
- bug fix: changed Y to ChannelY in LisPMCChannel
- fixed dumscreen syncronize and clean up loop after run in lismain

  (e.g. click run) a double click or enter behaviour is called
- added try.._finally loop in lismain to ensure cleanup of memory, screendump etc.
- map series are now set to min max of whole serie always, not only for PCRaster output

lisem 2.158 VJ 030702
- redone the wheeltrack module,
- moved pwheeltrack to before surface storage because of changes in WH

lisem 2.156 VJ 030627
- fixed typo xxxPdep = xxxPDep in all the code
lisem 2.155 VJ 030626

lisem 2.154 VJ 0340414 (?)
- FIXED channel bug , factor 1000
- added nutrient in channels
- added eros and depo totals for nutrients
- redesigned NUT kinematic
- added NUTmassbalsed for calculation of totals
- NOTE: changed calculation of MC sediment and NUTs to flux/flux
lisem 2.153
- ??? correct nutX_Q by nuXinfil adding? This goes into the soil so should be added
- corrected error display rainfall intensity in file and onscreen (was including DXc correction)
- corrected output sediment loss classes, was sum of suspended sed instead of sum sedoutflowMu#
- added nutrient infiltration loss to output (in mm = total/catchment area)
- corrected nutrient output
//- added check impossible result dir (e.g. drive that doesn't exist)
- function load runfile in IFace
- uses new csf dir and added error handling to "mperror.c" and "kernlcsf.c" to avoid
  output to stderr
- changed dumpscreen
lisem 2.152
- added lisinit.cpp for intialisation of main, iface and infiltration
- if no infiltration check then no kin wave infiltration
- corrected outflowname = '\0'
- removed TCCAL from interface and ini
- corrected start with different lisem type (resets all now)
lisem 2.15
- changed sediment routing in kineDX, minematic and ninematic
- mcalc does not seem to work as: mcalc("try += kkk#",6);
must be: calc("try += kkk0");calc("try += kkk1"); etc
- fixed bug in PMCsedmassbal.cpp -> sed discharge was reinitialised each timestep and divided by DTSEC!!!
- changed calculation of totals in lisfileoutput
lisem 2.14
- added option of profile = -1 as non-defined. in swatre init -1 circumvents the error notion of non existing profile and in swatstep it given a WH = 0 and infil = 0
  in lispinfswa: if grasswidth > 0 then profgras else -1
 - LisIFace + lismain : added switch for timeplot output
- LisIFace: SetTimeseriesMinmax function added, is called before the last timestep

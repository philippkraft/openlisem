1) The openLISEM model 
======================
openLISEM is an event based spatial flood, runoff and erosion model openLISEM. Thank you 
for downloading. openLISEM simulates the spatial dynamics of surface runoff and 
erosion for small plots of several m2 to catchments of >500 km2. 
Details on  the theory and dataset for now can be found on this website (in draft form):
https://sourceforge.net/projects/lisem/

openLISEM uses the freeware GIS PCRaster (http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl) for database creation and 
analysis of the results. 

INSTALL: just unzip the files to a directory of your choice.
Note that LISEM uses a number of DLL libraries, since version 4 and higher the library "qwindows.dll" 
has to be present in a subdirectory "platforms".

2) Terms of use

openLISEM source code install
=============================

1) The openLISEM model 
======================
This is the event based spatial flood, runoff and erosion model openLISEM. Thank you 
for downloading. openLISEM simulates the spatial dynamics of surface runoff and 
erosion for small plots of several m2 to catchments of >500 km2. 
 about the theory and dataset for now can be found on this website (in draft form). openLISEM uses the 
freeware GIS PCRaster (http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl) for database creation and 
analysis of the results. 

INSTALL: just unzip the files to a directory of your choice.
Note that LISEM uses a number of DLL libraries, since version 4 and higher the library "qwindows.dll" 
has to be present in a subdirectory "platforms".

-	Changes that are made to the code must be made available to 
the community. 

-	The process descriptions in a model are often a matter of 
choice. Please do not delete any of the model code if you want certain processes 
to be calculated differently, but add your processes as new options to the code. 
Also the LISEM run file has a certain layout that aims to be backward compatible and 
must remain so.

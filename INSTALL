openLISEM README 
================

LATEST CHANGES (v 1.26)
- fixed a bug that reported averages and totals (last version was affected)
- added calibration factors for theta and psi 
- added kinetic energy equations for rainfall splash 

1) The openLISEM model 
======================

This is the event based spatial runoff and erosion model openLISEM. Thank you for downloading. openLISEM simulates the spatial dynamics of surface runoff and  erosion for catchments of 1 ha to 500 km2. It is based on the LISEM model that  is available here: www.itc.nl/lisem. Details about the theory and dataset for  now can be found on this website (although a bit outdated). openLISEM uses the  freeware GIS PCRaster (http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl) for database creation and  analysis of the results. 

2) Terms of use 
===============
This software is free and open source, hosted by  sourceforge.net. The project details can be found on:  http://lisem.sourceforge.net

All license details can be found on this website. The compiled model openLISEM  and the source code, or parts of the source code can be used for any purpose,  but the disclaimer as specified below is in effect. openLISEM in any version  (compiled or as source code) cannot be sold or be part of a commercial package,  unless express permission is gained from Victor Jetten (jetten@itc.nl). If you  use this software for publications, please give the correct references in the  text (TO BE FURTHER SPECIFIED, contact victor jetten). 

3) openLISEM development 
========================
a) Code of conduct for developers
--------------------------------
-	Changes that are made to the code must be made available to 
the community. 

-	The process descriptions in a model are often a matter of 
choice. Please do not delete any of the model code if you want certain processes 
to be calculated differently, but add your processes as new options to the code. 
Also the LISEM run file has a certain layout that aims to be backward compatible and 
must remain so. 

-	If you add lines to the code, please give a comment with your 
initials, a date and a one-liner describing what you did: 
//VJ 101216 Solved bug x y 

- A list of author abbreviations and full names and addresses should be 
maintained in the header file version.h: 
/* VJ = Victor Jetten, Dept of Earth Systems Analysis, ITC, twente University, jetten@itc.nl */ 
Add your credentials to this list 

b) Downloading and compiling the source code 
--------------------------------------------
1.	openLISEM uses the Qt development environmwent. Install the developing 
environment. Everything is maintained in one single package by Nokia. There are 
two free LGPL versionsof the "Qt cross platform application and UI framework" 
(version 4.7.X or later), download the SDK version: 
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads 

2.	Qwt technical application widgets for Qt: (version 6.0.0) http://qwt.sf.net 
and https://sourceforge.net/projects/qwt/ 

3.	Tortoise SVN for version control: http://tortoisesvn.net/ 

c) Installation 
--------------- 

1.	Qt: install the package (e.g. in c:\Qt), including the MingW compiler. You 
do not have to recompile anything in Qt. After installation your directory looks 
like: c:\Qt\2010.05\bin c:\Qt\2010.05\mingw etc. In windows add the Qt and Mingw 
locations to your path: go to advanced system settings, click on environment 
variables and make a variable QTDIR= C:\Qt\2010.05\qt\bin and also add to your 
path: "C:\Qt\2010.05\mingw\bin;C:\Qt\2010.05\qt\bin;"  

2.	Qwt: the library to draw the graphs. Unzip the package for instance in c:\Qt 
(a directory c:\Qt\Qwt-6.0.0  is created). Rename this directory to "c:\qt\qwt" 
without the version number so you do not have to update the openLISEM project 
file all the time.  

3.	Compile the qwt libs: open in an editor the file qwtconfig.pri and edit the 
line where the qwt code can be found to the right location:  QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX 
= C:/qt/Qwt. Load qwt.pro in QtCreator and compile everything. In the 
c:\Qt\qwt\lib directory the libraries will appear. Note that if you distribute 
the openLISEM release version you need to add qwt.dll to the package. 

4.	Install Tortoise SNV, it will be integrated to your windows explorer. 

d) Compiling the code 
---------------------

1.	Make a directory where you want to install openLISEM (e.g. "c:\prgc\"). 

2.	TortoiseSNV: right click on this directory in windows explorer and select 
"SVN checkout" from the menu. In the field "URL of repository" give the source 
forge lisem address: https://lisem.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lisem/lisem and let 
Tortoise download the code. 

3.	Open QtCreator and load the project file "openlisem.pro". 
a.	Click on the left hand menu item 'Projects' and unselect 'Shadow build'. 
b.	Run build->rebuild all and run. 

4.	You can compile openLISEM in "debug" or as "release" executable. If you 
distribute openLISEM you have to add the libraries QtGui4.dll, QtCore4.dll, 
QtSvg4.dll and qwt.dll to the package. NOTE: There are two versions of the dlls, 
those in the directory c:/qt/2010.05/bin which are for QtCreator and other 
executables, the others are in c:/qt/2010.05/qt/bin, which are the ones you 
need! 

Good Luck

241125 - v7.4.2
- Adjusted the noInterface option. No works well on headless systems.
- BUG FIX: Swatre interface small bug fixes
- BUG FIX: 2nd page interface map list greyed out

241118 - v7.4
- major rewrite of MUSCL 2D flow with 2nd order and Heun averaging (see FullSWOF documentation of Delestre et al.)
- BUG FIX: small bug fixes in 2D flow
- BUG FIX: culverts work again, still small MB error but not very much

241114 - v7.3
- BUG fix: reading of [rainfall/ET/boundary waterheight/user discharge] time string, was malways rounded to whole minutes
- BUG fix: finding the right timeseries interval with the current time at the end of the series
- Known BUG: culverts do not work correctly
- Code made compatble for Linux compile, instructions for compilation updated

241107 - v7.2
- BUG fix: SWATRE reading of tables
- BUG fix: cleaning of SWATRE memory structures for rerun

241013 - v7.1
- BUG fix: SWATRE is working again
- BUG fix: Theta showed NaN in files
- TODO: Swatre does not interact with groundwater and may crash
- Small interface bug fixes and more logical positioning of options
- new option Tab houses, infrastructure and mitigation measures
- checked reset options of all tabs and overall reset

240714 - v7.00
- BUG fix: Lisem crashed when changing the displayed map after the run was finished
- Data remains in memory until the next run is started
- MUSCL option for 2D flow: cell boundary interpolation of water level and velocities (4 types). For high resolution flow.
- Advanced options: optional overall mass balance correction
- Moved to QT6, new libs
Interface
- Dark mode/Light mode 
- Some repositioning of options
- Rainfall, interception and infiltration can be switched on/off
- scrollbars correctly triggered

240523 - v6.99
- BUG FIX: in erosion causing zero flow detachment (only splash)
- boundary water level inflow (with whboundary.map and file with water levels), for dike break or coastal zone flooding
- Better hydraulics subsurface storm drains (sewage system) for urban environments (beta, some mass balance errors)
Interface
- Make mpeg movies of screenshot series after the simulation. Needs download MPlayer from http://www.mplayerhq.hu

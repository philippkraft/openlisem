<h2>Advanced parameters</h2>
<h3>Parallel processing</h3>
<p>All CPUs have more than 1 core that can be activated simultatneously for calculations. If the value is set at 0, all cores present are used. For small catchments this may not be faster (the overhead is more than the gain)!</p>
<p>New version: check if a new version is available in GitHub.</p>
<p>Correct mass balance: for some combination of maps the overall mass balance is not so good. Check this opytion to divide the mass balance error over all pixels that have runoff (this timestep t) and the infiltration of the next timestep (t+1). This artificially spreads the error over all cells with activity.</p>
<h3>Numerical parameters for dynamic flow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Riemann solver: smoothing functions that gives new states and fluxes on cell boundaries based on pressure and momentum differences. HLL are Harten-Lax-van Leer type solvers (def 4-HLL2c)</li>
<li>Use Heun 2nd order and averaiging: used with MUSCL to get a better estimate of water level and velocities (slower)</li>
<li>Max iterations: forces break out of n-th flood loop, usually not necessary, better to try different Courant conditions and minimum timesteps in the Flow tab (def 200).</li>
<li>Minimum height: water level (in m) before 2D calculations are done, below this height no flow is assumed</li>
<li>Time average V: more stable solution of 2D flkow (def on).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kinematic wave<strong><br /></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use linked list for kinematic flow: siwtched on means the linked list is recalculated each time kinematic wave is called (default off)</li>
<li>Perimeter overland flow width+2*height or wisdt only. Very old versions of LISEM had w+2h. In realty perimeter is somewhere between w and w+2h depedning on surface roughness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Channel flow<strong><br /></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Standard or iterative connection to channel: A fraction of the water beside the channel in a channe cell, is diverted to the channel. This fraction is based on the general flow velocity of the water [0], or based on the Manning's velocity using the terrain slope perpendicular to the channel [1].</li>
<li>Set channel max velocity: in some cases the channel velocity becomes excessive</li>
<li>Loop kinematic wave for channel flow is the timestep is more than 60 sec.</li>
</ul>

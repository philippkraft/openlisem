<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>Detachment efficiency</strong> <strong>based on soil cohesion (in kPa)</strong>: 3 equations can be chosen: and inverse linear function with cohesion (original LISEM), an exponential function (EUROSEM model) and an inverse linear function (MMF model). The linear function is tested for silty loams, the other functions are more general. Note that they give very different soil loss. Values 1-3: 1 - Y = 1.0/(0.89+0.56COH);\n2 - Y = 0.79 exp(-0.85 COH); 3 - Y = 1.0/(2.0*COH);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>Use sediment material depth</strong>: </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">the deposited material has a different cohesion than the original soil, and has a limited depth based on the bulk density.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Deposited particle cohesion: The cohesion of freshly deposited soil particles. This value is used in the calculation of splash detachment from the top layer.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Bulk density used to convert to volume (default 1600 kg/m3)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Spash detachment</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;">T</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">he equations describe non-linear relations between rainfall intensity (mm/h) and kinetic energy (J/mm):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 9pt;">A negative exponential equation with average global parameters (van Dijk 2002). values are a= 28.3, b =0.52, c=0.042.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 9pt;">A USLE type erquation with paraneters as found in the EUROSEM model (Morgan et al., 1998). a = 8.950, b=8.440</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 9pt;">A decreasing power law (Sanchez, 2012). a = 7.6, b = 0.22, This equation is available in an nintensity based and timebased version.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>Splash delivery</strong> is the fraction of sediment splashed from dry parts in a cell to ponded areas in a cell. The division of dry and ponded parts is calculated from the surface roughness and water height.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Conservation measures</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>Sediment trap</strong>: cells that trap all sediment (to simulate e.g. hedgerows or sediment traps) but not water. This uses the map "sedretmax.map", which has the maximum sediemnt retention in m3. The bulk density value is used to convert kg deposition to m3). There is no splash and flow detachment, and the water is slowed down by the mannings n factor given in the interface. When the trap is full the Mannings n returns to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>Grass strip: </strong>defined as cells with the width of a grass strip. Be aware of diagonal LDD conncentions crossing corners of the grass strip when using te kinematic wave! The Mannings n of a grass strip slows down the water, 0.2 is a high value for long grass. It is assumed that grass strips have no detachment but only sedimentation.</span></p>

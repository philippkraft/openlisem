<h3>Splash detachment</h3>
<p>Rainfall kinetic energy: the equations describe non-linear relations between rainfall intensity (mm/h) and kinetic energy (J/mm):</p>
<ul>
<li>A negative exponential equation with average global parameters (van Dijk 2002). values are a= 28.3, b =0.52, c=0.042.</li>
<li>A USLE type erquation with paraneters as found in the EUROSEM model (Morgan et al., 1998). a = 8.950, b=8.440</li>
<li>A decreasing power law (Sanchez, 2012). a = 7.6, b = 0.22, This equation is available in an nintensity based and timebased version.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Splash delivery</strong> is the fraction of sediment splashed from dry parts in a cell to ponded areas in a cell. The division of dry and ponded parts is calculated from the surface roughness and water height. For large gridcells use a small value to prevent overestimation of this effect (splash distances are 50 cm at most).</p>
<p><strong>Splash equation</strong> in Lisem aggregate stability is the median drop size to halve an aggregate (Lowe test): higher stability means <em>less</em> detachment. In Eurosem Aggregate stability is the opposite: it is the sediment delivery in g/J. Higher values mean <em>more</em> detachment!</p>
<h3>Flow detachment</h3>
<p>Detachment efficiency based on soil cohesion (in kPa): efficiency is a value from 0 - 1 multiplied with the detachment rate (depends on soil cohesion in kPa). 0 gives no flow detachment, 1 gives max flow detachment. openLLISEM is very sensitive to the efficiency. Generally 1 gives the most detachment&nbsp; and 2 the lowest detachment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Y = 1.0/(0.89+0.56*Cohesion)&nbsp; (original LISEM model, for silty loams)</li>
<li>Y = 0.79*exp(-0.85*Cohesion) (EUROSEM model)</li>
<li>Y = 1.0/(2.0*Cohesion) (Morgan, Morgan and Finney model)</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: eq 1 gives the highest flow detachment and is for fine material eq 2 the lowest, eq 3 in between the two.</p>
<p>NOTE: a negative cohesion value in coh.map or chancoh.map gives zero detachment (useful for concrete channels for instance)</p>
<h3>Two phase sediment transport</h3>
<p>Sediment is simulated in two layers: suspended and bedload. Transport capacities can be different for each layer, see below. The water depth is divided into a bedload layer depth and a suspended layer depth. Suspended transport is based on the D50 (median) value of the grainsize distribution, bedload on the upper D90 (upper 90% grainsize). Detachment and deposition are reported as the sum of the two.</p>
<p>For the channel and the surface flow (overland flow and flood) the transport cvapacities and turbulence parameters can be selected separately.</p>
<p><em>Bed load</em> transport capacity equation:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-Van Rijn Simplified (2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2-Van Rijn Full (1984)</p>
<p><em>Suspended load</em> transport capacity:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-Govers et al. (1990)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-Van Rijn Simplified (2007)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2-Van Rijn Full (1984)</p>
<p><em>Turbulent Prandtl-Schmidt Number</em> (p): a coefficient influencing the sediment diffusion in flood water (def.=0.5). Influence is inversly linear (Diffusion *= 1/p).</p>

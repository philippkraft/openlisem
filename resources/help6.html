<p><strong>Meteorological input</strong></p>
<p>Meteorollogical data is given in a separate folder. Default name is 'rain'. The data is given per tyime interval which is indicated by "ddd:mmmm", Julian day number (1-366) followed by the mninutre in the day (0-1440) (note that 0 = 1440 = midnight).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rainfall data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Rainfall gauging stations</em>. Values are geven in mm/h and the timeinterval should hourly or shorter. LISEM will work with larger time intervals (daily, weekly) but the results will be nonsense. Using raingauges needs a map ID.map with areas to which the raingauge corrersponds, using non-zero consequtive integer numbers (characters not allowed). Number 1 corresponds to the first gauge in the rainfall file, number 2 to the second The raingauge data is given as:</li>
</ul>
<p><code># A one line header, rainfall source</code><br /><code>4</code><br /><code>time</code><br /><code>gauge 1</code><br /><code>gauge 2</code><br /><code>gauge 3</code><br /><code>100:0230&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.0&nbsp; 4.3&nbsp; 17.2</code><br /><code>100:0240&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.0&nbsp; 14.3&nbsp; 7.2</code><br /><code>100:0251&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.2&nbsp; 8.3&nbsp; 87.2</code><br /><code>etc</code></p>
<p><code></code></p>
<ul>
<p>NOTE: the old rainfall file RUU format is no longer supported.</p>
<li><em>Rainfall maps (pcraster format)</em>. Values are geven in mm/h and the map format and size must be exactly the same as all other maps in the database. The map ID.map is not used. The source can be satellite images or interpolated stations. The rainfall maps are stored in the rain folder and can have any name. The rainfall file looks like this:</li>
</ul>
<p><code># A one line header, rainfall source</code><br /><code>2</code><br /><code>time</code><br /><code>maps</code><br /><code></code><code>100:0180&nbsp;&nbsp; rainfal.1.map</code><br /><code>100:0210 &nbsp; rainfal.2.map</code><br /><code>100:0240 &nbsp; </code><code>rainfal.3.map</code><br /><code>etc</code></p>
<p><strong>Evapotranspiration data</strong></p>
<p>The format of the input files is exactly the same as for rainfall, either station data with a map (ETID.map) or a series of ETp maps are used.</p>
<p>If the timeinterval is less than 1 day (e.g. hourly),&nbsp; the values are assumed to be in mm per timeintervall. Please make sure that the nighttime ET is zero.</p>
<p>If the interval is 1 day or more, the values are assumed to be in mm/day. In that case select the option "ET has daily or larger timesteps", and supply the average latitude (in degrees, e.g. 22.5) of the area. This will be used to calculate the sun engle and day length. The ETp provided in mm/d (in the gauges or maps files) is assumed to represent the daylight period and the instantaneous ETp per timestep is calculated according to a sine curve between sunrise and sunset.</p>
<p>If the time interval is longer than a day (e.g. derived MODIS 8 daily values), you still have to provide average daily ETp in mm/day, and the daily ETp is simply repeated for the 8 days until the next timestep is found in the input file.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced Sediment options</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two phase transport</strong>: sediment is simulated in two layers: suspended and bedload. Transport capacities can be different for each layer, see below. The water depth is divided into a bedload layer depth and a suspended layer depth. Suspended transport is based on the D50 (median) value of the grainsize distribution, bedload on the upper D90 (upper 90% grainsize). Detachment and deposition are reported as the sum of the two.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple grainsize classes (not active for now):</strong> the sediment grainsize is divided into multiple classes, which are either estimated form the D50 and D90 maps, or used defined class boundaries are given. When this is selected, iption 3 for transport capacity will be chosen (see below)</p>
<p><strong>Channel and surface flow</strong></p>
<p>For the channel and the surface flow (overland flow and flood) the transport cvapacities and turbulence parameters can be selected separately.</p>

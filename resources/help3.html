<h2>Infiltration options</h2>
<ul>
<li>SWATRE = 1D finite difference multilayer scheme for soil water balance based on the SWATRE model (Richards equations, multilayer Darcy equation solution), needs complex database setup</li>
<li>Green and Ampt = 1 to 3 layer infiltration based on a simplified solution for the Darcy equation (no iteration)</li>
<li>Smith and Parlange = 1 to 3 layer infiltration based on an exponential solution of the Darcy equation, liek a modified Green and Ampt</li>
<li>Richards equation = multi layer infiltration based a finite volume solution including unsaturated flow. The input is in 1 to 3 layers (same as Green and Ampt) that are subdivided in nodes. EXPERIMENTAL, does not work fully yet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impermeable</strong>: the lower soil boundary is impermeable and the soil profile can fill up with water and overflow to create runoff. When impermeable is witched off, there is drainage from the bottom of the soil profile and the soil is infinitely large.</p>
<p>When SWATRE is used the drainage is the Darcy flux from the bottom node, when G&amp;A or S&amp;P are used, the drainage is the estimated unsaturated conductivity (using the Brooks-Corey equation), assuming a hydraulic gradient dH/dz of 1.</p>
<p><strong>Nr layers</strong> (Green and Ampt or Smith and Parlange): infiltration and percolation for 1 to 3 layers, all infiltration maps needed for layer 1, 2 and 3 (ksat1.map and ksat2.map etc). Note that the soildep1 is the depth of the first layer, soildep2 is the depth from the surface to the bottom of the 2nd layer (soildep2 <em>contains</em> soildep1). Same for 3rd laer. Soildepth is in <em>mm</em>.</p>
<p>Apply<strong> Organic Matter</strong> correction and <strong>Density Factor</strong> correction based on pedotransfer functions of Saxton and Rawls (2006). This is a way to include an affect of landuse that miomics a change in organic matter and soil structure. Ksat and Porosity are increased by an increase in OM or a lower relative bulk density. A <em>decrease</em> in OM and an <em>increase</em> in relative density (more compact) will <em>decrease</em> Ksat and Porosity. The default values are OM=3.5% and BD=1350 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The OM correction is a direct percentage (between -2.0 and +2.0% organic matter) and Desnity Factor is a value between 0.9 (loose soil) and 1.2 (heavily compacted soil). Needs input maps OMcorr.map and densfact.map with these ranges of values).</p>
<p><strong>Compacted areas</strong><br />Cells which have a fraction of compacted area (compfrac.map) use the value in the maps ksatcomp.map (mm/h) and porosity porecomp.map (-) to affect infiltration in the top layer.</p>
<p><strong>Crusts</strong><br />Cells which have a fraction of crusted area (crustfrac.map) use the value in the map ksatcrust.map (mm/h) and crust porosity porecrust.map (-) to affect infiltration in the top layers.</p>

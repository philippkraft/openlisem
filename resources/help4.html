en using 2D dynamic flow there is no difference between runoff and flooding. In order to avoid spurious flood levels reported as "flood" a threshold level (in m, default 0.05) can be set to distinguish between a flood and non-hazardous surface flow or runoff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Initial water level</strong></p>
<p>A simulation can be started with an initial water level: supply a map called whinit.map which has water initial levels (in m).</p>
<p><strong>Buffers</strong></p>
<p>Buffers.map is a map added to the DEM, works only for 2D flow. Positive values (in meters) are gridcells added to the DEM (creating dikes), negative values are values that are subtracted from the DEM (creating depressions). Units are in meters.</p>
<p><strong>Flow Barriers between cells</strong><br />Barriers up to a given height (m) to disconnect flow between cells (only for 2D flow). The barriers are assumed to be on the cell boundary and have no physical thickness, only a height. Cells can be disconnected in the 4 directions NESW. This needs flowbarrier.map with codes 0 (no barrier), and 1, 2, 3 ... n. The numbers correspond to the text file flowbarriers.txt where the height of the barriers are given.</p>
<p><strong>2D dynamic wave parameters</strong><br />The SD Shallow Water Overland Flow (SWOF) equations are a semi-implicite finite volume solution, using progressively smaller timesteps to solve the St Venant flood equations, using a Riemann Solver and a Flux Limiter. Fluxes and states can be estimated at the cell boundaries or from the cell centers.</p>
<ul>
<li>SWOF 2.0: Simplified and very fast SWOF solution, using cell center values and a flux limiter only for the hydraulic pressure differences.</li>
<li>SWOF Cell centred solution: water pressure and velocities on cell boundaries based on a 1st order Taylor solution, only using information in the cell itself.</li>
<li>SWOF MUSCL solution: Water pressure and velocities on cell boundaries based on a 2nd order Taylor solution, using information in the cell and its neighbours in X and Y direction. Slower and more accurate. A MUSCL scheme estimates fluxes and states at cell boundaries (slow).</li>
<li>Time average velocity: Velocity of cells is a weighted average between two iteration steps (def on), use for stabler solutions and to avoid spurious velocities (def on)</li>
<li>Enable diagonal flow when blocked: water can be blocked in X and Y direction in 2D flow (a local depression, while a diagonal outlet exists. Diagonal outflows are not regarded in a 2D scheme. Enabling this uses the LDD to transport water and sediment to this diagonal cell (def on). The threshold pit depth is set at 0.1m (a guide value is 1% is the cell size or less).</li>
</ul>
<p>Courant factor: Determines minimum timestep, lower means smaller timesteps in the iteration are used. (def. 0.2, range 0.01-1.0).</p>
<p>Minimum timestep: User defined minimum timestep for dynamic wave solution. In case of instability lower this value (def. 0.2sec).</p>

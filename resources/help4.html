<h2>2D Surface Flow</h2>
<h3><strong>Dynamic Wave parameters</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Flow boundary (for 2D flow):</strong></p>
<p>0 - Closed boundary, outflow not allowed except in outflow points in outlet.map. Water can pool at the edges if the DEM is not perfect.<br />1 - Open Boundary: outflow to all sides possible of flood and overland flow. Outlets always allow outflow. (default)<br />2 - a user defined map (flowboundary.map) allows 2D outflow where the value is 1, and a closed boundary where the value = 0. A map filled with 1 is the same as unchecked, free outflow.</p>
<p><strong>Courant factor</strong>: Determines minimum timestep, lower means smaller timesteps in the iteration are used. (def. 0.2, range 0.01- 0.5).</p>
<p><strong>Minimum timestep</strong>: User defined minimum timestep for dynamic wave solution. In case of instability lower this value (def. 0.2 sec).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MUSCL solution</strong>: use a <em>Monotonic Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws.</em> Water pressure and momentum are calculated on cell boundaries, interpolating from cell centres. Gives a narrower flow and is slower. Can be more accurate in certain situations. (def. off)</p>
<p><strong>Enable diagonal flow</strong> when blocked: water can be blocked in X and Y direction in 2D flow (a local depression, while a diagonal outlet exists. Diagonal outflows are not regarded in a 2D scheme. Enabling this uses the LDD to transport water and sediment to this diagonal cell (def off). The threshold pit depth is set at 0.1 m. Can solve certain spurious pits that remain filled.</p>
<p><strong>Remove pits</strong>: set pit elevation to lowest surrounding cell in a 3x3 window (def. off)</p>
<h3>Boundary inflow</h3>
<p>There are two ways to impose a water level at the start of the run, this works only when 2D flow is selected for surface flow:</p>
<p>- A one time waterlevel that at the start that will behave as a flood and spread out (def. name WHlevel.map). The waterlevel is assumed to be in m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- A large flood or sea surge that has a changing water level with time. The water level is imposed in a given zone in a map (default name: <em>WHBoundary.map</em>).&nbsp; Where this map is '1', a water level (in m) will be implemented that is read from a file. This can be for instance a tidal wave. The file has the same format as the rainfall:</p>
<p><code># A one line header, rainfall source</code><br /><code>2</code><br /><code>time</code> (hour:min)<br /><code>water level (m)</code><br /><code>100:0230&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5</code><br /><code>100:0240&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.0<br />100:0251&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.34</code><br /><code>etc</code></p>
<p>NOTE: this wave does not have incoming momentum only pressure. As such it does not represent a strong 'destructive' wave like a tsunami</p>

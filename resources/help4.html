<p><strong>Flow boundary and barriers (for 2D flow)</strong></p>
<p>0 - outflow not allowed except in outflow points in outlet.map. Water can pool at the edges if the DEM is not perfect.<br />1 - outflow to all sides possible of flood and overland flow. Outlets always allow outflow. (default)<br />2 - a user defined map (flowboundary.map) allows 2D outflow where the value is 1, and a closed boundary where the value = 0. A map filled with 1 is the same as unchecked, free outflow. </p>
<p><strong>Buffers</strong></p>
<p>Buffers.map is a map added to the DEM, works only for 2D flow. Positive values are gridcells added to the DEM (creating dikes), negative values are values that are subtracted from the DEM (creating depressions). Units are in meters. </p>
<p><strong>Flow Barriers between cells</strong><br /> Barriers up to a given height (m) to disconnect flow between cells (only for 2D flow). The barriers are assumed to be on the cell boundary and have no physical thickness, only a height. Cells can be disconnected in the 4 directions NESW. This needs flowbarrier.map with codes 0 (no barrier), and 1, 2, 3 ... n. The numbers correspond to the textfile flowbarriers.txt where the height of the barriers are given. </p>
<p><strong>2D dynamic wave parameters</strong><br /> The SD Shallow Water Overland Flow (SWOF) equations are a semi-imnplicite finite volume solution, using progressively smaller timesteps to solve the St Venant flood equations, using a Riemann Solver and a Flux Limiter. Fluxes ans states can be estimated at the cell boundaries or from the cell centers.</p>
<ul>
<li>SWOF 2.0: Simplified and very fast SWOF solution, using cell center values and a flux limiter only for the hydraulic pressure differences.</li>
<li>Cell centred solution (0): Water pressure and velocities on cell boundaries based on a 1st order taylor solution, only using information in the cell itself. Faster but less accurate.<br /> MUSCL solution (1): Water pressure and velocities on cell boundaries based on a 2st order taylor solution, using information nin the cell and neighbours in X and Y direction. Slower and more accurate.</li>
<li>Time average velocity: Velocity of cells is a weighted average between two iteration steps (def on).</li>
</ul>
<p>Courant factor: Determines minimum timstep, lower means smaller timesteps in the iteration are used. (def. 0.2, range 0.01-1.0).</p>
<p>Minimum timestep: User defined minimum timestep for dynamic wave solution. In case of instability lower this value (def. 0.2sec).</p>

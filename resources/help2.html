<h2><strong>Interception options</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Canopy openess = factor describing the open area between the leaves in the canopy that causes direct throughfall. Default co = 0.45. This causes the throughfall fraction for instance with LAI 6 to be = exp(-0.45*LAI) = 0.067</li>
<li>Activate litter effect on interception and also splash erosion: using the map litter.map (0-1), assuming that the litter covers the entire cell (not only under vegetation, and has a storage increasing with cover from 0 to 2 mm</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Canopy storage equations: </strong>links LAI (in m2/m2) to storage capacity of the canopy (Smax in mm) for a set of researched vegetation types. This is the storage capacity of the plants, not of the pixel. So a tree in a pixel can have 2 mm of storage, but the average in the pixel depends on the cover raction.</p>
<p><strong>user defined:</strong> in case of varying land use/vegetation types, or a vegetation type not in the equations, the user can provide a canopy storage map, smax.map (mm)<br /></p>

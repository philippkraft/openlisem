<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Canopy openess = factor describing the open area between the leaves in the canopy that causes direct throughfall. Default co = 0.45. This causes the throughfall fraction for instance with LAI 6 to be = exp(-0.45*LAI) = 0.067</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Activate litter effect on interception and also splash erosion: using the map litter.map (0-1), assuming that the litter covers the entire cell (not only under vegetation, and has a storage increasing with cover from 0 to 2 mm</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>Canopy stiorage equations: </strong>links LAI (in m2/m2) to storage capacity of the canopy (Smax in mm) for a set of researched vegetation types. This is the storage capacity of the plants, not of the pixel. So a tree in a pixel can have 2 mm of storage, but the average in the pixel depends on the cover raction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>user defined:</strong> in case of varying land use/vegetation types, or a vegetation type not in the equations, the user can provide a canopy storage map, smax.map (mm)<br /></span></p>

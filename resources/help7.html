Calibration parameters

A value of 1.0 means that all input maps are used as they are. The value is a multiplication factor, larger than 1 increasees the map value, smaller than 1 decreases the map value. This has different effects:

    Ksat slope and channel: increase means more infiltration, less runoff.
    Theta: increase means a wetter soil and less infiltration, more runoff.
    Psi: increase means a drier soil with more suction, less runoff
    Manning N slope and Channel: increase means more friction, slower runoff.
    cohesion and aggregate stability: increase means a stronger soil and less detachment.

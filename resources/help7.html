<p><strong>Calibration parameters</strong></p>
<p>A value of 1.0 means that all input maps are used as they are. The value is a multiplication factor, larger than 1 increasees the map value, smaller than 1 decreases the map value.The effect is a matter of trial and error, a complex landscaope can behave in different ways, and scale is also important. In general</p>
<ul>
<li>Ksat slope and channel: increase means more infiltration, less runoff.</li>
<li>Theta: increase means a wetter soil and less infiltration, more runoff.</li>
<li>Psi: increase means a drier soil with more suction, less runoff.</li>
<li>Manning N slope and Channel: increase means more friction, slower runoff and channel response.</li>
<li>Cohesion and Aggregate stability: increase means a stronger soil and less detachment.
<ul>
<li>NOTE: Channel cohesion can be set to -1, in which case there is no flow detachment (but there is transport and deposition). This can be used for concrete channels for instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>D50: median grainsize for suspended matter. Influences the transport capacity and deposition. A larger value generally means a higher sediment flux, but also faster deposition</li>
<li>D90, the same as D50 but for bedload sediment tarsnport</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: less runoff means less erosion.</p>

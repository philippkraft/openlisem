<p><strong>Calibration parameters</p></strong>

A value of 1.0 means that all input maps are used as they are. The value is a multiplication factor, larger than 1 increasees the map value, smaller than 1 decreases the map value. This has different effects:
<ul>
    <li>Ksat slope and channel: increase means more infiltration, less runoff.</li>
    <li>Theta: increase means a wetter soil and less infiltration, more runoff.</li>
    <li>Psi: increase means a drier soil with more suction, less runoff.</li>
    <li>Manning N slope and Channel: increase means more friction, slower runoff.</li>
    <li>Cohesion and Aggregate stability: increase means a stronger soil and less detachment.</li>
    <li>NOTE: Channel cohesion can be set to -1, in which case there is no flow detachment (but there is transport and deposition). This can be used for concrete channels for instance.</li>
</ul>
Note: less runoff means less erosion.

The value is a multiplication factor, larger than 1 increasees the map value, smaller than 1 decreases the map value. This has different effects:</p><p>- Ksat slope and channel: increase means more infiltration and less runoff/discharge.</p><p>- Theta and Psi: increase means a wetter soil and less infiltration, more runoff.</p><p>- Manning N slope and Channel: increase means more friction, slower runoff and generally also less runoff (more time for infiltration).</p></body></html>

This library reads the native PCRaster format, formerely known as csf.
It is recommended to not use this library directly but instead use the Gdal library with PCRaster support.
A recent copy of the PCRaster format sources are always stored in the GDAL archives.

Even if you do not want to use Gdal but only libcsf: build Gdal, and extract the csf library build as part of the process.


Using the library directly
--------------------------

For information about how to use the library see csf.pdf which can found
at http://pcraster.geog.uu.nl. More information about PCRaster can be found at: http://www.pcraster.nl and http://pcraster.geog.uu.nl.

Questions can be directed to the PCRaster mailing list: http://pcraster.geog.uu.nl/support.html

Have fun!
